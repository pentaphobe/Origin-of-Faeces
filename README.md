## The Origin of Faeces ##

A game made in 23 hours for the [24th Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/) 48hr game creation jam.

It is a little glitchy at times, but it's worth noting I spent the last few hours before submission occasionally nodding off at my keyboard.  I'll be intermittently pushing changes as I go through and fix a few bugs and get it up to where I'd hoped it to be.

### Source ###

The source is mostly uncommented and messy in places - as can probably be expected given the time frame.  I intend to clean up the miscellaneous debugging code and comment it more thoroughly as I suspect it could be of some use to beginners.

### License ###

I really don't like license stuff, or software patents.  So do what you want with this source code, I'd like to know if you do anything cool though.

Let's say it's a Creative Commons Attribution License, and that Attribution could simply consist of telling me so I can point at your work and make my mum proud.

### Thanks ###

To everyone who participated in and (particularly) created Ludum Dare.
Thanks to [Chevy Ray](http://chevyray.com/) for making the [FlashPunk](http://flashpunk.net/)  framework that I could pick up in an unfamiliar language an hour or two before entering!
