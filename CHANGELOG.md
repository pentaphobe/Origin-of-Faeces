## Post-48hr Update/Bugfix

This version is not for rating - merely for my own sense of completion :)


### August 28

 - death screen originally only required ANY key to skip, which resulted in sometimes not seeing one's score.  There's also a slight delay before skipping
 - tweaked the physics of exiting a swing
 - added PAUSE via the 'P' key or losing focus
 - added non-magnetic items (for bonuses and the like)
